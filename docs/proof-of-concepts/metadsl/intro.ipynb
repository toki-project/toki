    "# Toki - Data Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "**last update: 2020-06-17**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Expression` is the base class used to create any kind of expression inside `toki`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `toki` expression is based on `metadsl` expression and, in general, it would create\n",
    "expression for `types`, `datatypes` and `operations`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Note: Currently there is no way to change `__init__` or `__new__` methods of an expression class.\n",
    "Each time an expression is instantiated, `metadsl` clones that expression, so the \n",
    "`__new__` method is called again and receive some parameters used by the `metadsl` expression.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we can define a method `expr` that will create a new expression for that class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "e = Literal.expr(1, type='int64')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Note: Every function, method or class should use typing.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, Toki core has the follow main modules: \n",
    "\n",
    "* api\n",
    "* datatypes\n",
    "* operations\n",
    "* rules\n",
    "* types\n",
    "\n",
    "The main expression classes should use `Expr` suffix, so it would be easy to identify what classes\n",
    "are the base classes, for example: `Expr`, `DataTypeExpr` `TypeExpr` and `OperationExpr`.\n",
    "Generally, these classes are not used directly, it can be used for typing or as base or metaclass classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## API\n",
    "\n",
    "`toki.api` is responsable to prepare `toki` API, create expression for each combination of \n",
    "operations and types and datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "`toki.datatypes` is responsible for defining all the data types expressions. Its main class \n",
    "is `DataTypeExpr`. All the other data type classes shouldn't use the suffix `Expr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial `toki` plan is adding support for numeric, text, boolean and date/time data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types expressions can be created using `expression constructor functions`. \n",
    "Generally, this constructors could be used with 1 positional parameter or a keyword `value`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* for `Int64`: `int64(1)` or `int64(value=1)`\n",
    "* for `Float64`: `float64(1.0)` or `float64(value=1.0)`\n",
    "* for `Date`: `date('2020-02-02')` or `date('2020-02-02')`\n",
    "\n",
    "Some expression constructors could have extra parameter, for example: `Decimal('1.1234', precision=4)`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Note: Internally, this module is commonly abbreviated as `dts`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "`toki.operations` is responsible for defining all the expression for operations, such as \n",
    "`Add`, `Subtract`, etc. Its main class is `OperationExpr`. All the other operation classes \n",
    "shouldn't use the suffix `Expr`. If it is a base operations used for other classes, the \n",
    "suffix `Op` should be used (e.g. `BinaryOp`).\n",
    "\n",
    "`toki` operations should have a `result_type` object that will be used to create a result expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a 2-steps expression: 1) it creates an instance of a operation expression and it \n",
    "is used as parameter for 2) a instance of a `datatype`, `type` or another `operation` expression, \n",
    "according to the `output_result`. It would looks similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "n1 = int64(1)\n",
    "n2 = int64(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "(n1 + n2) -> Add(left=n1, right=n2) -> IntegerScalar(parent=Add(left=n1, right=n2))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second step we could use the keyword `source` or `parent` or `value`. For now, \n",
    "`parent` will be used because the expressions are nodes in a graph. But it is opened for discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Note: Internally, this module is commonly abbreviated as `ops`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "`toki.rules` is responsible for defining all the expression types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Note: Internally, this module is commonly abbreviated as `rls`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types\n",
    "\n",
    "`toki.types` is responsible for defining all the expression types. For example the main `toki`\n",
    "expression class is `Expr`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Note: Internally, this module is commonly abbreviated as `tps`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backends subpackage\n",
    "\n",
    "`toki` aims to supply, initially, some base backends, such as `String Standard SQL` and `SQLAlchemy`, \n",
    "so new backends could just inherit from one of these backends. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "### Roadmap #1\n",
    "\n",
    "*(2020-05-30 - in progress)*\n",
    "\n",
    "`toki` is still on a **MVP** (Minimum viable product) stage. For this phase of the project, \n",
    "it aims adding initial support for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* basic datatypes (numeric, string, boolean and date/time)\n",
    "* basic operations to work with the initial datatypes\n",
    "* initial table, schema and projection (single or multiple columns) expressions\n",
    "* visualization \n",
    "* improve documentation (using jupyter-book and github pages)\n",
    "* packaging (pypi and conda-forge)\n",
    "\n",
    "## General notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* `toki` supports `python` >= 3.8."
