# Toki Roadmap

*(2020-05-30 - in progress)*

`toki` is still on a **MVP** (Minimum viable product) stage. For this phase,
it aims adding initial support for:

* basic datatypes (numeric, string, boolean and date/time)
* basic operations to work with the initial datatypes
* initial table, schema and projection (single or multiple columns) expressions
* visualization
* packaging (pypi and conda-forge)
